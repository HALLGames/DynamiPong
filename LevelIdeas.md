# Level Ideas

## New Levels
- Regular Pong
  - Essentially the template, but slightly improved

- Classic Pong Level
  - Classic design
    - Dotted Line through middle
    - Square ball
    - Classic bouncing
  - Classic sounds
  - Retro Shader
  - Retro font
  
- Themed levels
  - Cave level 
    - Rugged walls 
    - balls are boulders
  - Tennis Pong
    - Tennis Scoring
    - Tennis Ball, Paddle is racquet, background is tennis court
    - Tennis sounds
  
- Banana Pong
  - Everything starts out as bananas
  - Spawns different balls every time (not just bananas)
    - Jello ball - jello physics
    - Spiky Ball
    - Fish
    - Sword
    - Firework rocket
    - Battery
  - Paddle changes every time it hits the ball
    - Banana Paddle
    - String paddle - strechy
    - cell phone paddle
  - Paddles and balls may have different attributes that interact with each other
    - Ex. Battery ball may activate some effect on a cell phone paddle
  
- Pinball Pong
  - Point based, but not by scoring, but rather hit objects
    - When a ball goes out, it is given to your opponent to launch
    - Launching uses that "press when bar is full" mechanic
  - Paddles are not rectangles but a pair of pinball paddles
  - Objects may include:
    - Bumpers
    - Pathways
    - Cards/Buttons on the ground
  - Possibly: there is slight gravity toward the paddles from the middle, but then bother players would have to play at the same time - two+ balls active at once
  - Pinball sounds
  
- Asteroids Pong
  - Asteroids spawn on map
  - Paddles shoot the asteroids to prevent them from reach their goal
  - Asteroids split into smaller asteroids when shot (like in the game Asteroids)
  
- Paddle Inside the Ball
  - Paddle is inside the ball, paddle is arced, has two sides (like pizza crust but opposite slices are paddles)
  - There are two balls, one for each player
  - Camera zoomed in on ball, follows ball
  - When ball bounces off something, player takes damage unless they block the point of contact with their paddle
  
  ## Improvements to Existing Levels 

- Vortex Pong
  - Could use more dynamics, for example:
    - maybe the black hole could intermittently turn into a wormhole and teleport the ball to random location
    - Black hole changes size
  - SFX
  
- Powerup Pong
  - Fireball powerup
    - Paddle shoots a fireball that 
  - Sounds
  - Trail effects when affected by powerup
  
- Dodgeball
  - Bullet-hell style
    - The game spawns balls in a predetermined pattern
    - Patterns are generally slow moving but large
    - Patterns usually not affected by collision
  - Health
  - Movement in all directions (limit at halfway mark)
