Thank you for downloading DynamiPong!

DynamiPong can be started from the command line with the following arguments:
	- Use "-batchmode" (without the quotes) to start the program as a background process. This enables you to run a DynamiPong server without having to host as a player.
	- To start a server directly, use "-address myAddress" and "-port myPort" to specify which address and port you want DynamiPong to use. The game must be started in batchmode in order to use these commands. If a port is not specified, it defaults to 7777.
	
When you start DynamiPong in batchmode, it will run as a background process, and it will not show up as a program you can interact with. You will have to use the Program Manager to close the program.
